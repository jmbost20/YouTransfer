# YouTransfer: YouTube Transcript Generation with AdversarialVAE

This project utilizes Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook to pull transcripts from different YouTube videos and then applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate text using an AdversarialVAE (Variational Autoencoder) model.

## Introduction

YouTube Transcript Generation with AdversarialVAE is a project that combines the power of NLP and generative models to automatically generate text based on YouTube video content. By leveraging the transcripts available for YouTube videos, this project extracts textual information and employs an AdversarialVAE model to generate realistic and coherent text.

## Packages

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Transformers


## Data Collection

The first step in this project is to collect transcripts from various YouTube videos. The YouTube Data API can be used to retrieve video information, including transcripts, using appropriate API calls. You need to provide API keys and specify the desired YouTube video IDs to fetch the transcripts.

## Preprocessing

Once the transcripts are collected, preprocessing is performed to clean the text data. Preprocessing steps may include removing special characters, lowercasing, tokenization, and removing stopwords. These steps help in preparing the data for the AdversarialVAE model.

## AdversarialVAE Model

The AdversarialVAE model is a generative model that combines the principles of variational autoencoders and adversarial training. It consists of an encoder, decoder, and discriminator. The encoder encodes input text into a latent space, the decoder reconstructs the input text from the latent space, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated text. The model is trained using a combination of reconstruction loss, KL divergence, and adversarial loss.

## Results

The results of the AdversarialVAE model can be evaluated by comparing the generated text with the original YouTube video transcripts. Evaluation metrics such as BLEU score, perplexity, or human evaluation can be employed to assess the quality and coherence of the generated text.
